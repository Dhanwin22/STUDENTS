# Student Answer Predictor using HMM Model

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Student Answer Predictor using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The system predicts the correctness of a student's answer based on past responses and confidence levels.

## Model Used

The core of this project is the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). HMM is a probabilistic model that represents a system with hidden states and observable outputs. In this project, the hidden states represent the student's knowledge level, and the observable outputs are the correctness of their answers.

## Description

The Student Answer Predictor utilizes the HMM to predict the correctness of a student's answer based on their past responses. It takes into account the student's performance history and confidence levels to make predictions. The system is designed to assist educators in identifying areas where students may need additional support or intervention.

## How to Run
